    <h1>Factories and Constructors Function</h1>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
    <p>  Object literal syntax is not a good way to create an object and duplicate it.
         if this object has at least one method. 
         if an object has one or more methods, we say that object has bebavior, 
         like person that can do different things, so it has behavior.
        
         Creating objects with the object literal syntax is an issu only if that object has
         a behavior.
         So, what is the solution?
         => The solution is to use a factory or a constructor function.
